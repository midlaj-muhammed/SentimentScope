### 1. Project Breakdown  
**App Name:** SentimentScope  
**Platform:** Web  
**Summary:** SentimentScope is a premium web application designed to perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The app allows users to analyze text, URLs, and hashtags to determine sentiment and visualize the results in an interactive and visually appealing manner. With support for multiple languages, SentimentScope aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users looking to gain insights into the emotional tone of their content. The app features smooth animations, a modern design, and a user-friendly interface to ensure a premium feel.  
**Primary Use Case:** Users can input text, URLs, or hashtags to analyze sentiment, view visualizations, and export results for further analysis.  
**Authentication Requirements:** Authentication is optional for basic usage but required for saving analysis history and accessing advanced features. Supabase Auth will handle user authentication and session management.

### 3. Core Features  
1. **Text Analysis Section:**  
   - Users can input text directly into a textarea.  
   - The app processes the text using NLP to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).  
   - Results are displayed with a sentiment score and a pie chart visualization.  

2. **URL Analysis Section:**  
   - Users can input a URL to analyze the sentiment of the content on the webpage.  
   - The app scrapes the webpage, extracts text, and performs sentiment analysis.  
   - Results include a sentiment breakdown and a bar chart visualization.  

3. **Hashtag Analysis Section:**  
   - Users can input a hashtag to analyze sentiment across social media posts.  
   - The app fetches posts containing the hashtag, processes the text, and provides sentiment analysis.  
   - Results are displayed with a word cloud and sentiment distribution chart.  

4. **Visualization Dashboard:**  
   - Interactive charts and graphs (pie charts, bar charts, word clouds) to represent sentiment data.  
   - Smooth animations for transitions between views.  

5. **Multi-Language Support:**  
   - The app supports sentiment analysis in multiple languages using NLP libraries.  
   - Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu.  

6. **Export Results:**  
   - Users can export analysis results as PDF or CSV files.

### 4. User Flow  
1. **Landing Page:**  
   - Users land on a visually appealing homepage with a brief introduction and call-to-action buttons for each analysis type (Text, URL, Hashtag).  

2. **Input Section:**  
   - Users select an analysis type and input the required data (text, URL, or hashtag).  

3. **Processing:**  
   - The app displays a loading animation while processing the input.  

4. **Results Page:**  
   - Users are presented with sentiment analysis results, including a sentiment score, textual summary, and visualizations.  

5. **Export or Save:**  
   - Users can export results or save them to their account (if authenticated).  

6. **History (Authenticated Users):**  
   - Authenticated users can view their analysis history and revisit previous results.

### 5. Design and UI/UX Guidelines  
- **Color Palette:** Use a modern, premium color scheme with shades of blue, white, and gray. Accent colors like teal or purple can be used for highlights.  
- **Typography:** Use clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or Roboto) for readability.  
- **Animations:** Implement smooth transitions and micro-interactions (e.g., hover effects, loading spinners) using Framer Motion.  
- **Layout:** Use a grid-based layout with ample white space to ensure a clean and organized interface.  
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 6. Technical Implementation Approach  
1. **Frontend (React + Next.js):**  
   - Use Next.js for routing and page rendering.  
   - Create reusable components for input forms, charts, and results display.  
   - Use Framer Motion for animations and transitions.  

2. **UI (Tailwind CSS + ShadCN):**  
   - Style components using Tailwind CSS utility classes.  
   - Use ShadCN components for buttons, modals, and charts.  

3. **Backend (Supabase):**  
   - Store analysis results in a Supabase PostgreSQL database.  
   - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and session management.  
   - Implement real-time updates for analysis history using Supabase’s real-time features.  

4. **NLP Processing:**  
   - Use Python libraries (e.g., TextBlob, NLTK, or spaCy) for sentiment analysis.  
   - Integrate Python backend logic using a Next.js API route or a separate microservice.  

5. **Deployment (Vercel):**  
   - Deploy the app on Vercel for automatic scaling and continuous integration.  
   - Configure environment variables for Supabase credentials and API keys.
